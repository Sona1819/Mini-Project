#  DevOps Engineer Lifecycle – Mini Project

This mini project is a **real-world, hands-on DevOps Engineer training project** designed to simulate the **complete DevOps workflow** used in modern organizations.

It covers the full lifecycle from writing code ➜ containerizing ➜ automating builds ➜ deploying to cloud ➜ managing infrastructure as code ➜ configuring servers ➜ and monitoring systems — using **popular, in-demand tools** across the entire DevOps stack.

---

##  Project Objective

To demonstrate how a DevOps Engineer:
- Organizes code
- Builds a CI/CD pipeline
- Deploys a containerized app
- Provisions cloud infrastructure
- Manages servers
- Automates tasks
- Prepares a GitHub portfolio-ready DevOps project

---

##  What You'll Learn by Building This

- Git & GitHub version control workflow
- Docker image creation and container management
- Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for automation
- Kubernetes for application deployment and service discovery
- AWS (EC2, IAM, S3) infrastructure setup
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Ansible for server configuration management
- Bash shell scripting for automation
- How to structure and document a real DevOps repo

##  Tools & Why We Use Them

| Tool | Why It’s Used |
|------|---------------|
| **Git** | Version control system to track changes and collaborate. Used to manage codebase in GitHub. |
| **GitHub** | Cloud hosting for Git repositories. Source of truth for our project. |
| **Docker** | Packages the application with all dependencies into a container. Ensures the app runs the same everywhere. |
| **Jenkins** | Automates code integration, building, testing, and deployment via pipelines. Used for CI/CD. |
| **Kubernetes (K8s)** | Orchestrates and manages containerized apps. Auto-restart, load-balancing, and scaling. |
| **AWS EC2** | Cloud server (virtual machine) where the app runs after deployment. |
| **Terraform** | Automates creation of AWS resources like EC2, IAM roles, S3 buckets. IaC tool. |
| **Ansible** | Automates configuration and setup inside EC2 (e.g., installing Nginx, Node.js). |
| **Bash** | Used for Linux command scripting to automate local or cloud system tasks. |
| **.gitignore** | Keeps temporary or sensitive files out of Git tracking. |
| **README.md** | Documentation to explain the project clearly to recruiters and collaborators. |

<pre><code>
``` Mini-Project/ │ ├── app/ # Sample web app (Node.js or HTML) ├── docker/ # Dockerfile for containerization ├── jenkins/ # Jenkinsfile for CI/CD automation ├── k8s/ # Kubernetes deployment & service YAMLs ├── terraform/ # AWS infra setup using Terraform ├── ansible/ # Configuration playbooks (e.g., EC2 provisioning) ├── scripts/ # Bash scripts for automation tasks ├── .gitignore # Ignore unnecessary files └── README.md # Project documentation (this file) ```
</code></pre>

##  App Being Deployed

We’ll deploy a **simple static website (HTML)** or **basic Node.js app**:
- This app will live in a Docker container.
- It will be deployed to AWS via CI/CD pipeline.
- Kubernetes will manage its availability and scaling.

##  DevOps Workflow Overview

<pre><code>
 ``` [ Code ] → [ GitHub Repo ] ↓ [ Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline ] ↓ [ Docker Image Created ] ↓ [ Deploy to Kubernetes on AWS EC2 ] ↓ [ Infrastructure Provisioned via Terraform ] ↓ [ EC2 Configured with Ansible ] ↓ [ Logs & Monitoring (Optional Prometheus) ] ``` 
 </code></pre>

- You can build infrastructure & deploy real apps
- You know how to work with automation tools (Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible)
- You can containerize and orchestrate with Docker + Kubernetes
- You know how to manage code in Git and publish professional portfolios
